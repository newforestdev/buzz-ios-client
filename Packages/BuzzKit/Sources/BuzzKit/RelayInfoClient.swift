/// # Why this is worth fetching at all
///
/// The information document is served at the relay's own HTTP origin, **unauthenticated**,
/// and a Buzz relay answers it from a key it has never seen. That is the whole value: every
/// other route on a relay with `require_relay_membership` set answers `403` until an invite
/// has been redeemed, so this is the only thing a phone can learn about a community it is
/// deciding whether to join. Verified against a closed relay, which answers this and refuses
/// `/api/channels` in the same breath.
///
/// # What it can and cannot tell you
///
/// It **can** confirm that a real relay is reachable at that host over TLS, and that it is
/// running Buzz's own relay software (§ ``isBuzzRelay``).
///
/// It **cannot** name the community. `name` and `description` are the same hardcoded strings
/// on every Buzz deployment — `"Buzz Relay"` at `buzz/crates/buzz-relay/src/nip11.rs:154` —
/// and deliberately so: the document is unauthenticated, so a host-scoped fact in it would be
/// an oracle for enumerating the other communities on the same deployment. A build-time fence
/// at `nip11.rs:308-320` fails the build if anyone widens the inputs. So those two fields are
/// not read here at all, because the only thing a client could do with them is label every
/// community alike. § `CommunityIdentity` for what Hive shows instead — the same host-derived
/// name Buzz Desktop puts on the same relay.
///
/// The single exception, and the reason this type exists rather than a bare reachability
/// check: ``icon`` **is** host-scoped. It is the community's own workspace icon, set by its
/// owner and looked up per host (`nip11.rs:239-288`), and it is omitted entirely when unset.
