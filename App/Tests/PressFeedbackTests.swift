/// Not that a number is 0.14 — that is the constant restating itself. What these hold are
/// the *rules* the constants exist to express, each of which is invisible on a resting
/// screen and each of which a later hand can undo without noticing:
///
/// - **the shrink is 2.5% and it is centred.** The owner had the scale removed outright after
///   five rounds of it and then asked for it back on 2026-08-04, so the assertion that used to
///   be a negative measured on pixels is now a positive one measured the same way: a pressed
///   row lands 2.5% narrower than the resting one, and in the middle of where it was;
/// - **Reduce Motion takes the shrink and leaves the light**, which is what that setting
///   actually asks for — a cross-fade in place of a movement, not the absence of feedback;
/// - only a control with edges of its own washes: the owner had the grey treatment softened the
///   sidebar and off a message entirely;
/// - a press outlives the curve that draws it by nothing at all — it may never stand in front
///   of the action it is feedback for;
/// - an abandoned press comes off faster than a released one, with no minimum in front of it;
/// - a control inside a scroll view is handed the finger at touch-down rather than 150ms
///   later, which is the half of "the press can't be seen" that no constant could fix;
/// - and the treatment actually puts light on a screen, which is the only one of these that
///   no amount of reading the code can establish.
