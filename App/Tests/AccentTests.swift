/// The app's accent, and the two places it has to arrive for the app to be grey rather
/// than blue: SwiftUI, which reads a colour by name, and UIKit, which reads a window's tint.
///
/// Written as a test because the failure it guards against is silent and total. Nothing
/// warns when the catalogue's accent is not applied — every button, link, caret and mention
/// token simply draws in the system blue, which is a colour, so nothing looks broken.
///
/// # Why these name ``HiveTheme/hive`` instead of reading the live accent
///
/// They are about the *asset* and the *wiring*, not about which theme is chosen. Reading
/// ``HiveAccent/uiColor`` here made them assert "the app is grey" against a global the host
/// app writes at launch from `UserDefaults.standard` — so a machine whose simulator had ever
/// had a theme picked turned three of these red with that theme's own accent, which is not a
/// defect in anything they test. Naming the default theme asks the question they actually
/// mean. The live global has tests of its own, in ``AppSettingsTests``.
