/// The agent-mention glyph, in the three places it has a rule rather than a picture:
/// the flag reaching the token, the memo key that decides whether a cached render is
/// still valid, and the geometry that puts a 24-unit icon on a line of text.
///
/// The *drawing* is not here and cannot be: a `TextRenderer` needs a laid-out
/// `Text.Layout`, which cannot be built outside a view host, and `Text.customAttribute`
/// is invisible to everything else. It was verified by measuring a screenshot instead —
/// see the numbers in ``AgentGlyph``.
