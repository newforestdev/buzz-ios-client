/// The app's accent: the grey in `App/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AccentColor`.
///
/// The asset is read *by name* rather than through `Color.accentColor`, and the difference
/// is the whole reason this exists. Setting the catalogue's global accent — which this
/// project does, in `project.yml`, and which writes `NSAccentColorName` into the built
/// `Info.plist` — turns out not to reach either framework on iOS: measured on the simulator,
/// `Color.accentColor` resolves to sRGB (0, 0.569, 1) and a fresh `UIView`'s `tintColor` to
/// the same, which is the system blue, while the asset itself resolves to the grey it
/// holds. Everything the app had drawn "in the accent" was therefore drawing in blue.
///
/// So the accent is applied by hand, in three places, and each of them is one line:
///
/// - `.tint(.hiveAccent)` on the app's window group, for SwiftUI's own controls;
/// - ``SwiftUI/View/hiveWindowTint()`` on the same, for the UIKit chrome underneath —
///   alerts, menus, selection handles, the caret in a `UITextView`;
/// - `.hiveAccent` / ``uiColor`` at any call site that draws the accent itself.
/// The theme in force, held as something SwiftUI can **observe**.
///
/// # Why this exists at all, when a `static var` would hold a colour just as well
///
/// It was a `static var` first, and that shipped the defect this type is the fix for. SwiftUI
/// re-draws a view when a value it *read while building* changes, and it can only know about a
/// read it can see: `@Observable`, `@Environment`, `@State`. A bare global is none of those. So
/// every view that drew `Color.hiveAccent` and had no other reason to re-render kept the
/// **outgoing** accent after a theme change — the shortcut cards held their grey edge and wash
/// while the tab bar beside them went green, and which views updated depended on nothing but
/// whether something else happened to invalidate them first. That reads as random, and the
/// owner reported it as random.
///
/// Reading through `@Observable` puts all thirty-odd accent call sites back on the dependency
/// graph **without one of them changing**, which is why the fix is here and not spread across
/// them. Each still says `.hiveAccent`; the read now registers.
///
/// # Why a box rather than the environment
///
/// The accent is read from places that have no environment to read from — `static` colours on
/// style types (``PressFeedbackButtonStyle/fillColor``, ``RichTextStyle/tint``) and UIKit's
/// window tint. Those cannot take an `@Environment` and would each need a parameter threaded to
/// them from every caller. The environment carries the theme as well (`\.hiveTheme`), for the
/// ground; the two agree because both are written from the same preference.
///
/// # Isolation
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` with the same discipline the `nonisolated(unsafe)` global it replaces
/// documented: written on the main actor, read on the main actor. Marking it `@MainActor`
/// instead would push that annotation onto `Color.hiveAccent` and from there onto every call
/// site, for a value that has never been touched off the main thread.
