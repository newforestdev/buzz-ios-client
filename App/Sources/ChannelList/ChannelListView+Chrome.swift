/// at file scope is `fileprivate`, so anything touching the view's `@State` cannot be moved
/// out, and this is the part that does not.

/// gives — the language leaves no narrower option across files. Nothing outside

/// here with a caller elsewhere (``RootView``, while the identity gate is being composed).
