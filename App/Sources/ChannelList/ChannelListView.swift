/// The sidebar (§8): Starred, Channels, Direct Messages, and Agents as expandable
/// sections of compact rows, live from the store, with your face and the connection state
/// in the toolbar. Tapping a conversation pushes its timeline; a long press stars it; the
/// Channels heading's `+` opens the channel browser, where joining and creating live; a
/// pull refreshes the workspace.
///
/// # Why the app-wide environment lives here
///
/// This view is the only place *above* every pushed timeline, thread, and sheet, so it is
/// where the shared resolvers are injected: the `#channel` name→id map, the
/// name/avatar/conversation resolver, and the single clock behind relative timestamps. All
/// three are attached to the `NavigationStack` itself — above `navigationDestination` —
/// with the four `.task`s that drive them. A value injected *inside* the destination does
/// not reach the pushed view, so moving any down would cost every pushed surface its names.
///
/// It decides about the tab bar for the whole stack rather than leaving that to each
/// pushed view — see ``ChannelListTabBar``, which holds the measurements that put it here.
///
/// # Why some of this state is not `private`
///
/// The seven `@State var`s below — the surfaces that can sit on top of the sidebar, plus the
/// channel list itself — are read and written by `ChannelListView+Notifications.swift`, which
/// owns every navigation request arriving from *outside* this view tree. That split is not
/// taste: this file sits against swiftlint's 1000-line **error** ceiling, and a `private`
/// member is unreachable from an extension in another file, so the two go together. Everything
/// still `private` is local to this file, and nothing beyond those two files writes any of it.
