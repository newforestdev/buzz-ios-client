    /// must render identically to the same one reached from the sidebar.

    /// Then a row handed in by the surface that pushed. Since the membership flip the live
    /// list carries only channels whose roster names this identity, so a channel browsed
    /// but not joined is legitimately absent from it — and a freshly joined one is absent
    /// for as long as it takes the sidebar's own observation to see the roster commit. In
    /// both cases the pushing surface knows the channel's name and the list does not yet.

    /// what is known but not yet projected, and let the projection take over when it lands.

    /// taken while the browse sheet was open and it stays frozen for the life of the push,
    /// so no gate may read it. What a reader may *do* here is read live from the store by
    /// ``ChannelAccessModel`` on every commit.

    /// non-isolated caller reaches it. A test calling this off the main actor traps in
    /// `dispatch_assert_queue` — and only when `live` is non-empty, because an empty array
    /// never runs the closure. That is a crash which hides behind whichever cases happen to
