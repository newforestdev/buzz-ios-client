/// to the pixel size of the box it is about to fill, off the main thread, because that is what
/// keeps a list of pictures scrolling — so the bitmap the row is holding is a few hundred
/// points wide and has been re-encoded on the way. Saving that to someone's photo library, or
/// AirDropping it, would hand them a thumbnail of the thing they asked for.
///
/// So both actions run on the *original bytes*, fetched once and written to a file. That file
/// is also what makes the share sheet behave: `ShareLink` over a file URL gives every receiver
/// the real type and a real name — Mail attaches a `.jpeg`, Photos imports it as the format it
/// was posted in — where an in-memory `UIImage` arrives re-encoded and anonymous.
///
/// # Why a file and not `Data`
///
/// `PHAssetCreationRequest.addResource(with:fileURL:options:)` hands Photos the bytes as
/// authored. The `Data` overload does the same, but the file also serves the share sheet, and
/// fetching the same picture twice for two rows of one sheet is the kind of thing that is
/// invisible on a laptop and obvious on a phone holding a 12-megapixel photo.
