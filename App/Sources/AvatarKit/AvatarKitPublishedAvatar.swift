///
/// # Why this is a different question from "has anyone built an avatar"
///
/// ``AvatarKitRecipeStore`` answers "what was last built", which is the question the editor
/// asks when it opens: there has to be a face on the build tab whether or not it was ever
/// saved. This asks the other one — "is the avatar on this profile this app's own work" — and
/// the two part company the moment somebody builds a face and then publishes a photo instead.
/// Answering the first where the second was meant offers a reader an avatar they are not
/// wearing.
///
/// # Why it is the published string that is matched, and matched exactly
///
/// From the account editor a built avatar is published the way a photo is: drawn, `PUT`, and
/// the URL kept. Character for character it is the same *kind* of string, and nothing in the
/// value says which tab made it — so the only honest test is whether this device is the one
/// that put that exact string there. Being an equality it can never mistake a photo for a
/// build, and it also answers *no* the moment the picture becomes something else, without
/// having to be told that it did.
///
/// The arrival walk publishes a `data:` URI instead (§ ``AppEnvironment/publishableValue(for:)``)
/// and needs no other rule: an equality does not care which shape of string it is comparing.
///
/// # Why there is no second store under this name
///
/// The pair this needs — the URL that went out, and the avatar that produced it — is already
/// exactly what ``AvatarKitRecipeStore/Recipe`` holds, and every path that publishes one
/// already writes it. A second copy under a second key would be a second thing to keep in
/// step, and the failure that produces is the quiet kind: a row offering the face the editor
/// no longer agrees is the published one. So this is a name for the question rather than a
/// place to keep the answer.
