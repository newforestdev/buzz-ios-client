/// The Activity tab: everything addressed to you, one row per conversation, filtered by a

///
/// # The bug this screen exists to not have
///
/// The Flutter client renders **one row per event**, so nine replies from one agent in one
/// thread arrive as nine near-identical rows saying "Mention Jarvis" — which is what JT was
/// looking at when he asked for this. Nothing is wrong with its data; the grouping is
/// missing. Desktop groups by conversation and shows a count
/// (`desktop/src/features/home/lib/inbox.ts`, `buildInboxItems`), and so does this: nine
/// replies cost one row, one glance, and one tap.
///
/// # Its own stack, and the resolvers that has to carry
///
/// This tab owns a `NavigationStack` separate from the sidebar's, so a conversation opened
/// from here backs out to *here* rather than to the channel list. That is the whole point of
/// an activity screen — you came to clear a list and you want to return to it.
///
/// The cost is that the app-wide values ``ChannelListView`` injects into *its* stack do not
/// reach this one, and a value attached inside a `navigationDestination` never reaches the
/// pushed view. The Activity **rows** genuinely do not need them — the feed read resolves
/// author names and avatars in SQL — but everything a row *pushes* does:
/// ``ChannelTimelineView``, ``ThreadView`` and ``TimelineRowView`` all read `entityNames`,
/// and `TimelineRowView` also reads `channelNameMap` and `openConversation`. Without them a
/// conversation opened from here would draw every author as a short key and render its
/// `#channel` and `@mention` pills dead — while the identical screen reached from the
/// sidebar worked. So the same five are injected here.
///
/// They are read inside ``ActivityModel``'s existing observation rather than by standing up
/// a second ``EntityDirectoryModel`` and ``ChannelListModel``: that observation already
/// re-runs on every relevant commit, so this costs two more reads instead of two more
/// observations over the same tables. `openConversation` cannot be shared in any case — it
/// pushes onto *this* stack, and a shared one would push onto the sidebar's.
///
/// The tidier end state is to hoist the shared models above the `TabView` in ``RootView``
/// and leave only the per-stack actions here. Not done in this change: the sidebar owns
/// those models today and it is a screen with four just-shipped features on it.
