/// Joining a community by invitation, in three steps, on the same honeycomb the welcome screen
/// opens on.
///
/// # Why three, when this was two, and one before that
///
/// It was one screen on the argument that the reader is making a single decision — *do I want to
/// be in this* — and that everything they need in order to make it belongs in front of them at
/// once. That stopped being true as the screen grew: it carries the community and its terms, a
/// name, a picture, and a choice of key, and only the first is the decision. The rest are
/// consequences of having already made it.
///
/// So: **the community and its terms**, then **who you'll be in it**, then **the key that signs
/// for you**. The last two were one step, and splitting them is what this revision is for — the
/// name was a field above a key picker, which is the least similar pair of questions on the
/// screen, and it was the one people skipped. Desktop draws the same three
/// (`InviteRedeemForm.tsx:317` ends the invite step; `CommunityOnboardingFlow.tsx` runs profile
/// and key after it). The split itself is § ``JoinCommunityModel/Step``; this file draws it.
///
/// # Why it is not a `Form` any more
///
/// A grouped table is the right shape for several unrelated settings on one screen. This is a
/// walk with three stops, and — since the hero was rebuilt — it runs over an animated lattice
/// that a `Form` covers with an opaque slab. The steps are laid out by hand now out of the glass
/// cards in ``JoinCommunityChrome``, which are the same ones ``CommunityCard`` and
/// ``OnboardingRelayField`` already use on the screen this flow is entered from. Nothing the
/// table was doing is lost: its section headers are ``JoinCardLabel``, its footers are
/// ``JoinCardNote``, and its rows are the controls themselves.
