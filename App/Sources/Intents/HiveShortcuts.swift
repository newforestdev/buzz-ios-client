/// # Two things here are load-bearing, and neither can be read back
///
/// `AppShortcut` publishes initialisers and **no properties**, so nothing below can be
/// asserted by loading this list in a test. Both rules are therefore kept by hand here, and
/// by the one pin that can be written from the other side.
///
/// **Every phrase must contain `\(.applicationName)`.** A phrase without the app-name token
/// is dropped at build time — no error, no warning, just a Siri command that does nothing.
/// There is no way to assert it: this is verified by saying it to Siri on a device, and it
/// is the reason that check is first in the device pass.
///
/// **`systemImageName` is a literal because the compiler requires one** — it is declared
/// `_const Swift.String` in the framework, so a reference to wherever the name really lives is
/// a compile error here rather than a silent drift.
///
/// For Threads that gap is now permanent: the card draws the owner's own artwork, and this
/// takes a system symbol and nothing else — an App Intent tile cannot show an asset. So the
/// tile keeps `text.append`, which is the nearest system drawing, and `AppIntentsTests` pins
/// only that the name still resolves.
/// An SF Symbol the system does not have draws nothing at all, silently — the same trap
/// ``HomeShortcut/symbol(hasItems:)`` is already pinned against.
