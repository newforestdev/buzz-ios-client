/// # Why a queue and not a function call

/// An app intent can run at any moment of the app's life, and the most common one is the
/// worst one: the app is not running, Siri launches it, and ``perform()`` writes here while
/// ``RootView`` is still drawing ``AppEnvironment/Phase/needsIdentity`` or
/// ``AppEnvironment/Phase/bootstrapping``. The view that knows how to open Threads —
/// ``ChannelListView`` — does not exist yet, so there is nothing to call. A direct call
/// would land on the floor and the intent would open the app and stop on the sidebar, which
/// is the single most likely way this feature ships broken.
///
/// So the request simply *stays* here. ``ChannelListView`` reads it with
/// `.onChange(of:initial:)`, and `initial: true` is what makes a request made before that
/// view existed get picked up the moment it does. The reminder-alert path one file over
/// leans on the same pair for the same reason — a tap that launches the app writes its
/// value before the view is there to hear about it.
///
/// # Why it is owned by `AppEnvironment`
///
/// It has to outlive every screen, survive a community switch (``RootView`` keys the whole
/// workspace on the active community, so anything below that boundary is discarded), and be
/// reachable from a type the view tree does not own — an ``AppIntent`` reaches it through
/// `@Dependency`, registered once in ``HiveApp/init()``. ``AppEnvironment`` is the only
/// object built early enough and living long enough to be all three, which is the same
/// argument that put ``AppEnvironment/reminderAlerts`` there.
