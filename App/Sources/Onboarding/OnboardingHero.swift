/// It draws `SteelbeachMark` from the asset catalog rather than an SF Symbol hexagon. The symbol was
/// a stand-in and it read as one: a bare `hexagon.fill` sitting on a hexagonal lattice looks
/// like one more cell of the pattern, where the icon — bee inside the comb — is the thing a
/// reader already has on their home screen. The art is the same layer the icon is built from
/// (`steelbeach.icon/Assets/Group 2678.png`), copied into the catalog because the `.icon`
/// wrapper is compiled by `actool` for the launcher and its layers are not addressable by name
/// at runtime.
///
/// The glow behind it stays, quietly. It is what the honeycomb's radial falloff is aimed at, so
/// the lattice appears to radiate out of the mark rather than merely sit behind it.
