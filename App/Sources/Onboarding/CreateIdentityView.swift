/// It was a text button on the hero. Pressing it minted a secp256k1 key, committed it to the
/// Keychain and signed the reader in, against whatever address happened to be sitting in the
/// relay field — no confirmation of where, no chance to say who they were, and no statement
/// anywhere that the phone in their hand had just become the only copy of a key. That last part
/// is the one this app owes people a sentence about, and there was nowhere to put it.
///
/// So: **where you're going**, **who you'll be there**, **the key**. The same three the join
/// walks (§ ``JoinCommunityModel/Step``) and the same order, because it is the same arrival with
/// a different door — and the profile step is literally the join's, reused
/// (``JoinCommunityProfileStep``), so a reader who does both meets one screen twice rather than
/// two screens that ask the same thing differently.
