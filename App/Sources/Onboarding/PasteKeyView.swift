/// Bringing an existing `nsec` onto this phone, in two steps.
///
/// The key is held only in the field until submit, committed to the Keychain, and never retained
/// afterwards — unchanged, and the reason this file's rewrite is presentation only.
///
/// # Why two steps and not the `Form` this was
///
/// It was a grouped table with a relay field and a secret field on it, which is the right shape
/// for several unrelated settings on one screen and the wrong one for this: these are two halves
/// of one sentence — *this key, on that relay* — and the table drew them as peers with a system
/// grey slab over the lattice the reader had just arrived from. Now it walks the way
/// ``CreateIdentityView`` and ``JoinCommunityView`` do, on the same honeycomb and out of the same
/// glass cards.
///
/// # Why there is no profile step
///
/// The other two walks ask for a name and a picture. This one must not. A kind-0 is replaceable
/// and Hive writes a fresh one on arrival rather than merging into what the relay already holds
/// (§ ``AppEnvironment/announceArrivalProfile(displayName:emoji:color:)``), so asking a reader
/// who is bringing an identity they already use to fill in a name here would be offering to
/// overwrite the profile that identity already has. The account screen is where an existing key
/// changes its own name, with its current values in front of it.
