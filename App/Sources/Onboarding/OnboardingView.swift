/// join with an invite, create a brand-new identity, or paste an existing `nsec`. The relay
/// field is shared by Create and Paste; the Scan path takes its relay from the QR instead.
///
/// ## Why the screen is shaped this way
///
/// The routes have not changed and neither has anything they do — this is presentation. What
/// changed is that the old screen presented all four as equals under a relay field that was the
/// largest thing on it, so the first decision a reader made was about a URL they had usually
/// already been given. Now:
///
/// - **Scanning leads**, because a reader on a phone with Buzz open on their desktop is the
///   common arrival, and it is the one route that needs no relay typed at all;
/// - **the relay collapses** to a line once it holds something usable, and opens itself back up
///   the moment it does not — the field is still there, it just is not the headline;
/// - **create and paste stay in reach** as a text row rather than a fourth and fifth slab. They
///   are the routes for a reader who already has a relay of their own, which is not most people
///   opening this screen for the first time.
