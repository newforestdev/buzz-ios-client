/// The preferences that belong to the *app* rather than to any one community.
///
/// # Why these are not per-community
///
/// Almost everything in Hive is scoped to a community: the store, the engine, the key, the
/// sidebar. These are the exceptions — a reader who has turned alerts off has turned them off
/// on this phone, not in one of three relays, and a phone that asked the same question once per
/// community would be asking about a switch iOS only has one of. So this object is built by
/// ``AppEnvironment``, which outlives the per-community graph, and survives a community switch
/// untouched.
///
/// # Why `UserDefaults` and not the relay
///
/// The same reasoning as ``StarredConversations``: a preference is a statement about how one
/// person uses one phone. Publishing it would put it on a relay for nobody's benefit, and it
/// would then have to be reconciled against a second device that disagrees. Local, and only
/// local.
///
/// # Adding the next one
///
/// One stored property with a `didSet` that writes it, and one key beside the others. Nothing
/// else — ``SettingsView`` draws a row per setting and no registry has to learn about it. A
/// setting that is not a `Bool` reads through its own `defaults` accessor in `init` the way
/// ``notificationsEnabled`` reads through ``flag(_:default:)``; the point of the helper is the
/// **default**, which `UserDefaults.bool(forKey:)` cannot express — it answers `false` for a key
/// nobody has written, and a preference that silently starts off on a phone that has been
/// upgrading fine is a feature that has quietly stopped working.
