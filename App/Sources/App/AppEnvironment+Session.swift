    /// community signs with its own Keychain account (§ ``Community/keychainAccount``), and
    /// a sign-out that cleared only the active one would leave a recoverable `nsec` on the
    /// device for every other community. `.keyNotCleared` is returned if *any* key survived
    /// its delete.

    /// Unlike the single-community version this tears down even when a key survives. With
    /// one identity, refusing to tear down left the app exactly as it was; with several,
    /// some keys are already gone by then, so the running session is signing with an
    /// identity the reader has asked to remove. The reader is told the truth by the result
    /// and left on a clean screen rather than a half-live one.
    ///
    /// The community *records* and their databases are intentionally kept. That is the
    /// single-community rule carried forward — the recorded owner decides at the next
    /// sign-in (§ ``StoreOwnership``), so a same-key return keeps its history and a
    /// different key wipes it. Removing a community for good is a different action, and it
    /// says so: ``removeCommunity(_:)``.
