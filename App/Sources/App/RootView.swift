            //    the action runs. This modifier is built inside `InAppNotificationHost.body`
            //    (the `content` closure is invoked there), so Observation registers the
            //    dependency against that view.
            // 2. `InAppNotificationHost` is a strict *ancestor* of ``ChannelListView`` — it
            //    is the view that yields the `TabView` that yields the tab that yields it.
            //    Ancestor-before-descendant evaluation is structural, not a heuristic.
            //
            // So this modifier has already latched the destination before the descendant can
            // nil it. Move this read to a sibling of the tab content, or interpose anything
            // that caches the child's view value, and a request made while the Activity tab
